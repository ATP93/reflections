How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows only changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see separated changes for individual features. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: better logical structures for versions (one commit = one whole change); Cons: you have to do this manually - it takes time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git serves mainly for programmers - one change can happen in multiple files at once.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
