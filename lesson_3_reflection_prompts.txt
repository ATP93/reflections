When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I work on the project with multiple people or just want to keep all of my work online in order to avoid risk of losing data related to local machine issues.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In order to prevent the Git of overriding my unsaved work at inappropriate time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork works only on github - clones github (remote) repo to another one and also stores additional info (such as link to original repo and links to all forked repos). Clone creates a local copy of another repository. Branch is part of repository and works with commits just inside of it. 
    When to use it:
    Fork - to create GitHub repo copy of an existing one. 
    Clone - to create local copy, or it's not on GitHub or don't want to be referred as fork of repo. 
    Branch - inside of repository for features/versions of same project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
